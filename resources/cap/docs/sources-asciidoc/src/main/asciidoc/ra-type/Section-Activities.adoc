= Activities

An {this-ra} activity object represents a set of related events in an {this-ra} resource.
This RA Type defines only one activity object: 

CAPDialog::
  All the events related to {this-ra} Dialog and events related to Service are fired on this activity.
  This activity ends implicitly when {this-ra} stack sends P-Abort or explicitly when user aborts the  Dialog or end's the Dialog.
  Class name is `org.restcomm.protocols.ss7.cap.api.CAPDialog`
  New CAPDialog activity objects are created via specific {this-ra} Service interface. Check <<ra-type/Section-Resource_Adaptor_Interface.adoc#_ratype_ra_interface,Resource Adaptor Interface>> section for available services.
  Depending on service used, activity object provides additional set of methods. For instance Circuit Switched Call dialog: org.restcomm.protocols.ss7.cap.api.service.circuitSwitchedCall.CAPDialogCircuitSwitchedCall exposes methods specific for exchange of call related messages.
