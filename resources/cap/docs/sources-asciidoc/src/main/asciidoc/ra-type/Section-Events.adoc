In addition, when call set up failure occurs, such as called party busy or no answer, the gsmSSF also sends a charging report (if previously requested).
| CALL_GAP_REQUEST | CallGapRequest | This operation is used to request the gsmSSF to reduce the rate at which specific service requests are sent to the gsmSCF.
| CALL_INFORMATION_ REPORT_REQUEST | CallInformationReportRequest | This event contains the call-related information that was previously requested for this call.
| CALL_INFORMATION_ REQUEST_REQUEST | CallInformationRequestRequest | This operation is used to request call-related information.
| SEND_CHARGING_ INFORMATION_REQUEST | SendChargingInformationRequest | This operation may be used by the gsmSCF to send advice of charge information to the served subscriber

1) It may be used to disarm armed detection points and to cancel requests for reports. It is normally used when a CAMEL service wants to terminate the relationship
2) It may be used to prevent or stop the execution of a user interaction operation, which was previously sent to the gsmSRF or to the intelligent peripheral.
| ACTIVITY_TEST_REQUEST | ActivityTestRequest | The activity test (AT) is used for testing the CAMEL dialogue between the gsmSCF and the gsmSSF. The SCP may send CAP AT at regular intervals to the gsmSSF, e.g. every 15 min. The only function of CAP AT is to verify the existence of the CAMEL dialogue. When the gsmSSF receives CAP AT, it returns an empty RESULT to the gsmSCF. If the gsmSCF does not receive an operation RESULT within the operation time for CAP AT, e.g. 5 s, then the gsmSCF terminates the CAMEL service. CAP AT is normally sent by the SCP platform, not by the CAMEL service. The arrival of CAP AT in the gsmSSF has no impact on any call handling process or on the BCSM. The sending of CAP AT is not dependent on the phase of the call or on the gsmSSF FSM state
| ACTIVITY_TEST_RESPONSE | ActivityTestResponse | Response to ActivityTestRequest

The gsmSSF continues call processing with the modified call setup information as received from the gsmSCF.
| DISCONNECT_LEG_REQUEST | DisconnectLegRequest | This operation is used by the gsmSCF to release a specific leg associated with the call and retain any other legs not specified in the DisconnectLeg. Refer to clause 11 for a description of the procedures associated with this operation.
| DISCONNECT_LEG_RESPONSE | DisconnectLegResponse | Response to DisconnectLegRequest
| MOVE_LEG_REQUEST | MoveLegRequest | This operation is used by the gsmSCF to move a leg from one call segment to another call segment within the same call segment association.
| MOVE_LEG_RESPONSE | MoveLegResponse | Response to MoveLegRequest
| SPLIT_LEG_REQUEST | SplitLegRequest | This operation is used by the gsmSCF to separate a leg from its source call segment and place it in a new call segment within the same call segment association.
