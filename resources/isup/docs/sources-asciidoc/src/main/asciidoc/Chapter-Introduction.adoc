The ISUP - User Part or ISUP - is part of the Signaling System #7 which is used to set up telephone calls in Public Switched Telephone Networks. It is specified by the ITU-T as part of the Q.76x series.

ISUP messages are used to convey call related information between PSTN switches.

The telephone switches are connected via E1 or T1 trunks which transport the speech from the calls. Trunks are divided into 64k/bit timeslots. Each time slot is identified with unique Circuit Identification Code (CIC). The switches uses this information along with the received signalling information (Called Party Number, Calling Part Number...) to determine which inbound CICs and outbound CICs should be connected together to provide an end to end speech path.

Additionally ISUP is used to exchange status information about switch capabilities and current resources.
